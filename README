Work in progress.

Description
===========

Similar to the iPhone "sudoku grab" app, my intention is to create a mobile
app which can solve kenken puzzles input via the camera.

Current state:
 * given a crappy iphone snapshot of a kenken:
  * locate the puzzle's corners
  * perspective transform this image into a square
  * figure out the size (3x3, 4x4, 5x5, etc) of the puzzle
  * figure out the cage layout of the puzzle
